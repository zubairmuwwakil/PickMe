# Contracts changelog

One entry per catalogue/fixture change (spec §3). Newest first.

## 2026-08-16 — Extraction

- Moved `card-catalogue.json`, `benefits-catalogue.json`, `engine-fixtures.json` here from
  `Engine/Sources/CardCopilotEngine/Resources/` and `Engine/Tests/CardCopilotEngineTests/Fixtures/`.
  This directory is now the single canonical home; the Engine package keeps drift-checked
  copies at the old paths because SPM cannot declare resources outside a package's own root
  (see `scripts/sync-contracts-into-engine.sh` and `ContractsSyncTests`).
- Replaced the ad hoc `2026-08-15.1` date-stamp versioning with `catalogueVersion: "1.0"`
  (MAJOR.MINOR) and made it load-bearing: `SeedLoader` now parses MAJOR and refuses to load a
  catalogue whose MAJOR it does not recognize. `engine-fixtures.json` gained the matching
  `fixturesVersion: "1.0"` for the same convention, ahead of any future non-Swift consumer.
- Added `schema/card-catalogue.schema.json` and `schema/engine-fixtures.schema.json`,
  documenting the current shape as decoded by `CardCopilotEngine` — including fields the
  engine decodes but never acts on, and fields present in the JSON that the Swift model
  doesn't declare at all and so are silently dropped by `JSONDecoder`.
